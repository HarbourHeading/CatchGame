# CatchGame
## Summary
The program runs a game of "Catch", where you collect eggs into a basket
to get scores. Not catching an egg will make you lose a life, which you only
have 5 of. Losing all 5 lives gives a game over screen where the top scores
will be displayed and added to if you got more points than one of the top 3
scores. A retry button is present in the game over screen. Controls are
A/Left_arrow (Left) or D/Right_Arrow (Right).
