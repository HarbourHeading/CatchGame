# Catch Game

Catch is a game where you catch falling objects. Each caught object gives the player a point
and each missed object makes the player lose health. The game is written in java and
built with maven.

## Play

The game starts in a paused state. Press the ESC key to unpause. Use A or left arrow to move left,
and D or right arrow to move right. Upon losing all 5 lives, you are greeted with a game over screen.
The game over screen displays the top 3 scores. If your score beats one of them, it replaces the lower score
permanently.
